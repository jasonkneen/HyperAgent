# Docs Guidelines

## Scope
- Applies to `docs/`.
- Inherits root `AGENTS.md`.

## Documentation Accuracy
- Keep docs aligned with current runtime behavior and public API contracts.
- Reflect architecture-impacting changes in `currentState.md` and relevant docs together.
- Use terminology consistent with root and source-level AGENTS guidance.

## Maintenance
- Prefer concise, task-oriented docs with concrete commands and file references.
- Remove or update deprecated guidance when behavior changes (do not leave parallel truths).
