# Assets Guidelines

## Scope
- Applies to `assets/`.
- Inherits root `AGENTS.md`.

## Asset Management
- Store production-ready static media only.
- Use clear, stable filenames that describe purpose.
- Keep asset updates scoped to actual product/docs/README needs.

## Hygiene
- Prefer optimized files and avoid unnecessary duplicates.
- Do not commit proprietary source exports unless policy explicitly allows it.
